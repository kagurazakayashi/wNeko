## Neko for HTML5

[ネコネコネ ~](https://www.yoooooooooo.com/yashi/demo/wneko/)

Neko is a little cat who sits on the webpage and chases the
mouse pointer around.

When you run the demo webpage `index.html`, a webpage is opened with Neko inside it.

As you move the mouse, Neko will follow. If the mouse is inside the webpage and it is not moving, Neko will go to sleep. When the mouse is moved Neko will awake and will chase the mouse. If the mouse is outside the window and it is not moving, Neko will scratch the webpage window boundary and goes to sleep.
